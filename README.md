# README for Service Level Agreements #

## Thoughts ##
- If the tool was real, I would expand the material to walk through some of the mechanics of the feature. For example, how to apply/configure an SLA.
- I use `notation like this` to indicate new and specific terminology. I'd need to check Pega's style guidelines to ensure consistent usage across all material
- I like building an understanding for *why* in the minds of learners. It definitely helps those who don't already have a conceptual understanding for a topic. The need for SLAs seems intuitive enough that I can see many people skipping the section named *Why have a Service Level Agreement?*. That's fine. I wrote the material so it could be skipped by experienced learners.  There's nothing in later sections that depend on someone having read this. In my experience, experienced learners already come to the table with a conceptual understanding. They just want to skip to the meat of the content, get their questions answered, and move on. 
    - This section is where I got to be a bit more playful, tell a story, and do character development
    - I try to use discretion in terms of when my writing uses whimsy and when it's more straight forward.
- This might not be a bad script/outline/starting point for what could eventually become a video.
- I added a graph because I felt inspired to create one. It's a risky addition though. Publishers don't like placeholder art, and it may seem out-of-place.


## Wishlist/Brainstorming Item 1 ##
I was inspired by this scene from The Office. I wanted to somehow work it in. I decided against it for a few reasons:
- I had already indulged in some playful scenarios and it was time to get more serious
- Although the Urgency Value section is the most logical place, again, people who already have a conceptual understanding will skip to this section and expect meat, not fluffy gimmicks and distractions
- I doubt NBC would allow us to use content like this in actual curriculum

I was thinking of writing something like this:
### Poor Use of Urgency ###
The paper company Dunder Mifflin has a counter productive use of urgency. SLAs via Pega could help improve company communication and help the business be more efficient.

[![Urgent A, Urgent B, Urgent C, Urgent D](img/TheOfficeUrgent.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqGe9TOmnyE "Urgent A, Urgent B, Urgent C, Urgent D")
*Oscar Martinez: I'd say communication could be improved. People stop reading memos, so everyone marks them 'Urgent'.\
Michael Scott: Okay, you know what? I mark it Urgent A, Urgent B, Urgent C, Urgent D.  Urgent A is the most important.  Urgent D, you don't even really have to worry about.*

## Wishlist/Brainstorming Item 2 ##
I want pictures! Normally I'd incorporate screenshots of the product and incorporate those. I especially wanted a screenshot after the Overview section, which shows a bunch of tasks of varying urgency. They could be real, or playful. Things like:
- Approve timecard
- Feed cat
- Submit budget
- Perform code review
- Prepare presentation for CEO

I'd also explore including a picture of the configuration steps found in the Example section. It's tempting to draw something. But creating a good UI design risks becoming a rabbithole, so I felt it was better to skip this for now. I've done plenty of image work in for curriculum in the past.

## Wishlist/Brainstorming Item 3 ##
This is a very passive eLearning deliverable. I try to tell interesting stories and have a bit of whimsy in my language, but still... Customers are just passively reading. It's in stark contrast to some of my other portfolio pieces, which include games, demos, videos, etc... 

How would I incorporate some degree of interactivity? Maybe in the *Urgency Value* section? For example, I could create a quiz to ask people to choose the most urgent task. But it's a trick question. All the tasks are marked Urgent. The goal is to show the paralysis employees face when they're drowning in a sea of everything being urgent. It takes more work to sort through all that to find truly urgent tasks. Or without the extra effort to sort tasks, there's a risk that employees waste effort performing tasks that really aren't urgent. The value of Pega's SLA is that it does this sorting and dynamic adjustment for the company.

But then I also wondered... Will the target audience see this as an unwelcome gimmick and distraction? SLAs seem pretty intuitive, and dare I say, trivial to the point of being susceptible to over-explanation.
